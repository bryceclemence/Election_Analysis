# Election Analysis

### 1: Overview of Election Audit

  The purpose of this election audit was to see the outcome of votes from three counties and declare a winner of this year's local election.
In doing this, we used our knowledge of python to extract data from a csv file containing all of the votes for the three counties, and provide an easy to understand analysis of 
how many people voted in the election, who they voted for, and from which county they were from. This was an excellent way to introduce us on how python can be used to review
large amount of data quickly, without having to review every single line of data in an excel or csv file.

### 3. Election Audit Summary
  This election audit was extrmely successful, and could be used to audit other local county elections in the future. Provided with a file of the election results we can modify our for loops to read through the candidate names and votes in the specific format the data is in. We could also add another for loop and if statement to see what party each candiate belongs to, so we can analysis that party's popularity in certain counties/areas and include voter demographics and preference.
